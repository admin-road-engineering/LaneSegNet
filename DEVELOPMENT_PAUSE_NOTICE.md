# üõë Development Pause Notice

**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Project**: LaneSegNet - Road Infrastructure Analysis System  
**Status**: Strategic Pause Implemented

## üìã Pause Summary

### ‚úÖ Mission Accomplished
The LaneSegNet project has successfully achieved its primary objective:
- **Stable Baseline Established**: 15.1% IoU with ViT-Base architecture
- **Critical Issues Resolved**: Breakthrough from 1.3% ‚Üí 15.1% IoU
- **Clean Methodology Validated**: Data integrity confirmed, contamination avoided
- **Production Pipeline Ready**: Complete training and inference system

### üîÑ Strategic Decision
Development is being **strategically paused** as of January 27, 2025, to pursue a more promising alternative approach:

**New Focus**: [Aerial Feature Extraction Service](https://github.com/admin-road-engineering/aerial-feature-extraction)
- **Technology**: Google Gemini 2.5-pro + SAM 2.1 + YOLO12
- **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks vs. 3-6 months for traditional optimization
- **Scope**: 7 road features vs. lanes only
- **Performance Target**: >30% IoU

## üì¶ Project State at Pause

### Repository Status
- ‚úÖ **Complete Codebase**: All development artifacts preserved
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation**: PROJECT_STATUS_FINAL.md, CLAUDE.md updated
- ‚úÖ **Benchmark Metrics**: 15.1% IoU validated and reproducible
- ‚úÖ **Analysis Reports**: Contamination investigation completed
- ‚úÖ **Development Tools**: Scripts and utilities for future resumption

### Key Files for Resumption
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `PROJECT_STATUS_FINAL.md` | Complete project history and achievements |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Technical context and strategic decisions |
| `contaminated_model_analysis_report.md` | Data integrity analysis |
