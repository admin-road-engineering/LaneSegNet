# LaneSegNet Enhanced Implementation Plan

## Project Vision & Scope

LaneSegNet is evolving from a basic aerial lane detection system to a **comprehensive road infrastructure analysis platform** that serves as a specialized microservice for the Road Engineering SaaS ecosystem. This system provides competitive advantage through AI-powered infrastructure detection exceeding current industry standards.

### Enhanced Scope (2024)
- **Multi-class infrastructure detection**: 12 lane marking classes + pavements, footpaths, utilities
- **Coordinate-based analysis**: Geographic coordinates → Infrastructure analysis pipeline
- **Real-world measurements**: Areas in m², lengths in meters, engineering-grade precision
- **Integration architecture**: Seamless integration with road-engineering frontend platform
- **Premium feature positioning**: Targeting 80-85% mIoU vs 76% industry SOTA

## Phase 0: Critical Research & Validation ⚠️ **COMPLETED**

### Research Findings Summary

#### 1. MMSegmentation Model Architecture ✅
**Finding**: MMSegmentation supports custom class configurations through config modifications
- **Solution**: Fine-tune pre-trained ADE20K models for 12 lane marking classes
- **Implementation**: Custom dataset class + config updates required
- **Performance Impact**: Expect 5-10% initial performance drop during fine-tuning phase

#### 2. Imagery Acquisition APIs ✅
**Google Earth Engine**: 
- **Commercial pricing**: Enterprise tiers with EECU-based billing
- **Implementation complexity**: HIGH - Requires Cloud project setup, quota management
- **Coverage**: Global with historical data access
- **Recommendation**: Secondary provider due to complexity

**Mapbox Satellite API**:
- **Pricing**: $50/month minimum, tile-based billing
- **Implementation complexity**: MEDIUM - Standard REST API
- **Coverage**: High-resolution US/Canada/Europe + global coverage
- **Recommendation**: Primary provider for production

**Planet Labs**:
- **Pricing**: Custom enterprise pricing (>$10k/city coverage)
- **Implementation complexity**: MEDIUM - REST API with tasking options
- **Coverage**: Daily global coverage, sub-meter resolution
- **Recommendation**: Future enhancement for high-resolution needs

#### 3. Code Architecture Gap Analysis ✅
**Critical Gap Identified**: `/analyze_road_infrastructure` endpoint exists but still expects image uploads instead of coordinate input
- **Gap**: Complete imagery acquisition pipeline missing
- **Gap**: Coordinate transformation utilities implemented but not integrated
- **Gap**: Response schema mismatch (lane markings vs comprehensive infrastructure)

#### 4. SOTA Performance Validation ✅
**Current Industry Standards**:
- **General lane detection**: 79.5% F1-score (CLRNet), 96.84% accuracy (TuSimple)
- **BEV semantic segmentation**: 61.5% mIoU across 8 classes
- **Aerial-specific**: Limited research, multi-drone achieved 69.73% mIoU
- **Assessment**: 80-85% mIoU target is aggressive but achievable with ensemble methods

#### 5. Geographic Precision Requirements ✅
**Engineering Survey Standards**:
- **RTK GPS precision**: 1-2cm accuracy, 0.1mm precision
- **Survey grade requirements**: Sub-centimeter for road infrastructure
- **Implementation impact**: High-resolution imagery (0.1-0.5m/pixel) required for engineering precision

### Research Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Imagery acquisition API costs for production scale
- **Medium Risk**: Model performance achieving 80-85% mIoU target
