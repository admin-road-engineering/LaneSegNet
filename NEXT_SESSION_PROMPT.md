# Phase 3 Implementation Prompt - Production Deployment & Model Optimization

## Session Context & Continuation

**Previous Session Summary**: Successfully completed Phase 2.5 with production-ready local aerial imagery testing, proper physics filtering (debug bypass removed), and comprehensive documentation updates. Discovered substantial training dataset of 39,094 annotated samples ready for model fine-tuning.

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **Phase 2.5 Complete** - Ready to begin Phase 3 implementation

## üéØ Primary Objective

Implement **Phase 3.1: Production Infrastructure** to prepare for model fine-tuning on 39,094 annotated training samples, targeting 80-85% mIoU performance improvement.

## üîÑ Immediate Tasks (Phase 3.1 - Week 1)

### **Priority 1: Geographic Indexing System**
```
CRITICAL: Implement coordinate-to-image mapping for 7,819 local aerial images

Current Issue: Random image selection doesn't match frontend coordinate requests
Solution Needed: Geographic indexing system that maps coordinate bounds to specific local images
Impact: Enables accurate coordinate-based analysis using local imagery

Files to Modify:
- app/imagery_acquisition.py (LocalImageryProvider class)
- Create coordinate indexing database/mapping system
- Update API to use coordinate-based image selection
```

### **Priority 2: Unit Testing Framework**
```
CRITICAL: Prevent debug code from reaching production

Current Gap: No automated testing to catch production issues
Solution Needed: Comprehensive unit testing with physics filtering validation
Impact: Ensures production safety and prevents debug bypass incidents

Files to Create:
- tests/test_physics_filtering.py
- tests/test_api_endpoints.py  
- tests/test_image_acquisition.py
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (CI/CD pipeline)
```

### **Priority 3: Load Testing Validation**
```
IMPORTANT: Validate concurrent request handling performance

Current Unknown: Performance under multiple simultaneous requests
Solution Needed: Load testing framework with concurrent user simulation
Impact: Validates 750ms response time target under load

Implementation:
- Load testing script for /analyze_road_infrastructure endpoint
- Concurrent request simulation (10-50 users)
- Performance monitoring and bottleneck identification
```

## üìä Training Dataset Ready

**CONFIRMED AVAILABLE**:
- **Training Set**: 27,358 samples (70%) in `data/train_data.json`
- **Validation Set**: 3,908 samples (10%) in `data/val_data.json`  
- **Test Set**: 7,828 samples (20%) in `data/test_data.json`
- **MMSegmentation Format**: `data/ael_mmseg/` directory structure ready
- **Geographic Coverage**: 7 international cities with ground truth annotations

## üö® Current System Status

### **‚úÖ Production-Ready Components**
- **Physics Filtering**: Debug bypass removed, intelligent fallback system implemented
- **Local Imagery**: 7,819 images accessible via Docker mounting
- **API Integration**: FastAPI endpoints compatible with road-engineering frontend
- **Visualization**: Side-by-side detection overlay system functional
- **Performance**: 750-1080ms response times with 9-10 detected elements

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Gaps (Address in Phase 3.1)**
1. **Geographic Indexing**: Random image selection vs coordinate-based lookup
2. **Unit Testing**: No automated testing framework
3. **Load Testing**: Unknown concurrent performance
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: No prevention of debug code in production

## üéØ Phase 3 Complete Timeline

### **Phase 3.1 (Weeks 1-2): Infrastructure**
- **Week 1**: Geographic indexing + Unit testing framework
- **Week 2**: Load testing + CI/CD pipeline + Performance optimization

### **Phase 3.2 (Weeks 3-5): Model Training**
- **Week 3**: Training pipeline setup + Baseline evaluation
- **Week 4-5**: Full training on 27,358 samples + Hyperparameter optimization
- **Target**: 80-85% mIoU (15-20% improvement from current 65-70%)

### **Phase 3.3 (Week 6): Production Deployment**
- **Week 6**: Caching system + Hybrid providers + Final integration

## üíª Development Environment

### **Docker Status**
```bash
# Current container should be running with local imagery mounted
docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=lanesegnet"

# If not running, start with:
docker run -d --name lanesegnet-local -p 8010:8010 --gpus all \
  -v "C:\Users\Admin\LaneSegNet\data:/app/data:ro" lanesegnet
```

### **API Status Check**
```bash
# Verify current functionality
curl http://localhost:8010/health
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8010/analyze_road_infrastructure" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"north": -27.4698, "south": -27.4705, "east": 153.0258, "west": 153.0251}'
```

## üìã Success Criteria for Next Session

### **Week 1 Deliverables**
1. **Geographic indexing system operational** - Coordinate requests return appropriate local images
2. **Unit testing framework established** - Physics filtering and API endpoint tests
3. **CI/CD pipeline functional** - Automated testing prevents production issues
4. **Load testing baseline** - Performance metrics under concurrent load documented

### **Validation Tests**
```bash
# Geographic indexing test
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8010/analyze_road_infrastructure" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"north": -27.4700, "south": -27.4707, "east": 153.0260, "west": 153.0253}'
# Should return image matching coordinate region, not random image

# Unit testing validation
python -m pytest tests/ -v
# Should pass all physics filtering and API tests

# Load testing validation  
python load_test.py --concurrent-users 10 --requests-per-user 5
# Should maintain <1000ms response times under load
```

- **PHASE_3_PLANNING.md**: Complete 6-week implementation plan
- **PHASE_2_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md**: Current status and next steps

## üöÄ Getting Started Commands

```bash
# 1. Verify current system status
curl http://localhost:8010/health

# 2. Check training data structure  
ls -la data/
cat data/train_data.json | head -5

# 3. Review current implementation
grep -r "LocalImageryProvider" app/
grep -r "def apply_physics_informed_filtering" app/

# 4. Start Phase 3.1 implementation
# Begin with geographic indexing system in app/imagery_acquisition.py
```

**üéØ FOCUS**: Implement geographic indexing system as Priority 1, followed by unit testing framework. The 39,094 training samples are ready for Phase 3.2 model fine-tuning once infrastructure is complete.

**‚ö° URGENCY**: Production infrastructure must be solid before starting computationally expensive model training (potentially days/weeks of GPU time).
