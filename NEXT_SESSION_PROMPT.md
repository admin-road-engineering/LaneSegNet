# ðŸŽ¯ Next Session Prompt: LaneSegNet Phase 2 Model Enhancement

## Session Context

Continue development of the **LaneSegNet road infrastructure analysis system**. Phase 1 (Docker infrastructure and validation) is **COMPLETE** with all achievements committed to GitHub (commit `ac7193e`). The system is **production-ready** but requires model accuracy improvements for premium feature targets.

## Current System Status âœ…

**Infrastructure**: Docker containerization with MMCV dependencies resolved  
**Performance**: 1.16s response time (42% faster than 2s target)  
**Detection**: 37 lane segments across 6 marking types  
**Integration**: Production-ready API with OpenStreetMap imagery  
**Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and validation reports  

## Critical Performance Gap ðŸŽ¯

**Current Model Accuracy**: 45-55% mIoU  
**Target Model Accuracy**: 80-85% mIoU  
**Performance Gap**: 25-40% improvement needed  

**Root Cause**: Using general ADE20K weights (150 classes) instead of specialized lane marking training (12 classes)

## Phase 2 Objectives

Your task is to **enhance model accuracy** from 45-55% to 80-85% mIoU through:

### Priority 1: Specialized Model Training (HIGH IMPACT)
1. **Research lane marking datasets** - Find datasets with 12-class lane marking annotations
2. **Acquire proper training data** - Download or access lane-specific datasets (AEL, CULane, etc.)
3. **Fine-tune the model** - Adapt Swin Transformer from ADE20K to lane marking detection
4. **Validate performance** - Benchmark against 80-85% mIoU target

### Priority 2: Enhanced Computer Vision Pipeline
1. **Implement lane-specific post-processing** - Edge detection, line fitting, temporal smoothing
2. **Add physics-informed constraints** - Lane width, spacing, geometric validation
3. **Improve class detection** - Expand from 6 to 12 lane marking types
4. **Optimize inference pipeline** - Maintain <2s response time

### Priority 3: Production Validation
1. **Performance benchmarking** - Test accuracy against industry standards
2. **Load testing** - Validate concurrent request handling
3. **Integration testing** - Frontend compatibility with enhanced model

## Current Working Environment

**Docker Container**: `lanesegnet:latest` (25.2GB, CUDA 12.1)  
**Container Status**: Running on port 8010 with model loaded  
**API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8010/analyze_road_infrastructure`  
**GitHub Status**: Clean, all changes committed  

## Key Files to Review

**Performance Assessment**: `MODEL_PERFORMANCE_ASSESSMENT.md` - Current performance analysis  
**Docker Status**: `DOCKER_VALIDATION_SUCCESS.md` - Infrastructure validation results  
**Implementation Guide**: `CLAUDE.md` - Complete development documentation  
**Model Configuration**: `configs/mmseg/swin_base_lane_markings_12class.py` - Current model config  

## Suggested Session Start

1. **Review performance assessment** - Read `MODEL_PERFORMANCE_ASSESSMENT.md` for detailed analysis
2. **Research lane datasets** - Investigate AEL, CULane, Tusimple datasets for 12-class training
3. **Plan model enhancement** - Create todo list for specialized training approach
4. **Implement improvements** - Fine-tune model or enhance post-processing pipeline
5. **Validate performance** - Test accuracy improvements and benchmark results

## Expected Outcomes

**Target Achievement**: 80-85% mIoU model accuracy  
**Class Enhancement**: 6 â†’ 12 lane marking types  
**Performance Maintenance**: Keep <2s response time  
**Production Readiness**: Enhanced model ready for premium features  

## Context Commands

```bash
# Check current system status
docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=lanesegnet"
curl http://localhost:8010/health

# Review current performance
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8010/analyze_road_infrastructure" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"north": -27.4698, "south": -27.4705, "east": 153.0258, "west": 153.0251}'

# Check git status
git log --oneline -3
git status
```
