# LaneSegNet Project Status Update
**Date:** January 26, 2025  
**Phase:** 4 - ViT-Base Optimization with Contamination Context

---

## Executive Summary

The LaneSegNet project has evolved from a performance crisis (1.3% IoU) to a methodical optimization phase focused on a clean, legitimate baseline (15.1% IoU). A critical investigation into a contaminated model claiming 85.1% mIoU has validated the current approach and highlighted the importance of proper data integrity.

**Current Status:** Ready to proceed with systematic ViT-Base optimization using proven clean training methodology.

## Performance Timeline

| Phase | Performance | Method | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Initial** | 1.3% IoU | ViT from scratch | ❌ Failed |
| **Breakthrough** | 15.1% IoU | Pre-trained ViT-Base | ✅ Stable baseline |
| **Contaminated** | 85.1% mIoU | Premium U-Net (data leakage) | ❌ Invalid |
| **Current Target** | >20% IoU | Optimized ViT-Base | 🎯 In progress |

## Key Findings from Contamination Investigation

### The 85.1% Model Reality
- **Architecture:** Premium U-Net with Attention (8.9M parameters)
- **Fatal Flaw:** Training data contaminated with validation data
- **Current Status:** Model weights exist, architecture code missing
- **True Performance:** Expected 5-20% IoU on genuinely unseen data

### Why This Matters
1. **Validates Current Approach:** Clean 15.1% baseline is the correct foundation
2. **Highlights Data Integrity:** Proper train/val separation is crucial
3. **Realistic Expectations:** 15.1% → 20-25% is a reasonable optimization target
4. **Methodology Validation:** Current systematic approach is sound

### Available Unseen Test Data
- **OSM Aerial Images:** 550 images from diverse geographic regions
- **Cityscapes Aerial:** 80 urban environment images
- **Status:** Ready for testing when model architectures are available
