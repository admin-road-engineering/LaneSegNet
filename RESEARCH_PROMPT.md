# LaneSegNet Research Phase - Critical Technical Validation

## Research Mission
Conduct targeted technical research to validate key architectural assumptions for LaneSegNet aerial infrastructure analysis system before implementation. This system will serve as a premium microservice for the Road Engineering SaaS platform, requiring professional-grade accuracy and performance.

## Critical Research Questions

### 1. MMSegmentation Model Architecture Compatibility ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Question**: How can we adapt MMSegmentation models to detect 12 specific lane marking classes instead of generic "road" class?

**Current State**: 
- Code uses ADE20K pre-trained models (road class index 6)
- Need: 12 specific classes: `single_white_solid`, `single_white_dashed`, `single_yellow_solid`, `single_yellow_dashed`, `double_white_solid`, `double_yellow_solid`, `road_edge`, `center_line`, `lane_divider`, `crosswalk`, `stop_line`, `background`

**Research Focus**:
- Fine-tuning strategies for custom lane marking classes
- Dataset requirements for training 12-class lane marking models
- MMSegmentation config modifications needed
- Performance implications of class granularity increase

### 2. Coordinate-Based Imagery Acquisition APIs ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Question**: What are the practical limitations, costs, and implementation complexity for acquiring aerial imagery from geographic coordinates?

**Research Focus**:
- **Google Earth Engine**: API access requirements, rate limits, pricing for commercial use, resolution capabilities
- **Mapbox Satellite API**: Pricing structure, resolution limits, coverage areas, rate limits
- **Alternative providers**: Bing Maps, Planet Labs, commercial satellite providers
- **Implementation complexity**: Authentication flows, image format handling, coordinate projection requirements
- **Cost analysis**: Estimated monthly costs for 1000+ coordinate requests

### 3. SOTA Performance Benchmarks Validation üîç MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Question**: Is our target of 80-85% mIoU realistic and competitive for aerial infrastructure detection?

**Current Claim**: Industry SOTA is 76.11% mIoU, we target 80-85%

**Research Focus**:
- Latest research papers on aerial lane marking detection (2023-2024)
- Benchmark datasets: Aerial Lane Dataset (ALD), TuSimple, CULane adaptations for aerial imagery
- Performance metrics: mIoU, F1-score, precision/recall for infrastructure detection
- Multi-class vs binary segmentation performance trade-offs
- Recent advances: Vision Transformers, multi-scale fusion, temporal consistency

### 4. Geographic Coordinate Precision Requirements üîç MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Question**: What coordinate precision is required for professional engineering applications?

**Research Focus**:
- Engineering survey standards (centimeter vs meter precision)
- Coordinate reference systems (WGS84, local projections) for road engineering
- Measurement accuracy requirements for lane width calculations
- Error propagation from imagery resolution to real-world measurements
- Industry standards for road infrastructure surveying

### 5. Code Architecture Gap Analysis üîç HIGH PRIORITY
**Question**: What's the gap between current implementation and planned coordinate-based system?

**Current State Analysis**:
- `app/main.py`: Has `/detect_lanes` endpoint expecting image upload
- `app/schemas.py`: Defines `GeographicBounds` and infrastructure classes
- `app/imagery_acquisition.py`: Placeholder implementation
- `app/coordinate_transform.py`: Geographic transformation utilities

**Research Focus**:
- Required changes to migrate from image upload to coordinate input
- Integration points with existing MMSegmentation inference pipeline
- CORS and API design for frontend integration
