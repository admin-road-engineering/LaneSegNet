### Detailed Detection Analysis

| Metric | Current Performance | Target | Status |
|--------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| **Response Time** | 1.16 seconds | <2 seconds | ✅ **EXCEEDS** |

## 🔍 Critical Performance Gap Analysis

### 1. Model Architecture Mismatch (IDENTIFIED ISSUE)
**Current State**: ADE20K pre-trained weights with 150 classes  
**Required State**: 12-class lane marking detection  
**Impact**: Model is detecting road surfaces but mapping to limited lane classes

```python
Expected Classes: 12 (lane markings)
Current Classes: 150 (ADE20K general segmentation)
Class Mapping: Limited to 6 detectable lane types
```

### 2. Detection Quality Assessment
**Positive Indicators**:
- ✅ Consistent detection of `single_white_dashed` markings
- ✅ Proper polyline generation with 20-180 pixels per segment
- ✅ Geographic coordinate transformation working accurately
- ✅ Real-world measurements (lengths: 5.8-18.0 meters, areas: 1.16-3.60 m²)

**Performance Limitations**:
- ⚠️ Only detecting 1 primary class (`single_white_dashed`) consistently
- ⚠️ Missing other lane marking types (solid lines, yellow markings, crosswalks)
- ⚠️ Using general-purpose ADE20K weights instead of lane-specific training

### 3. Current vs Target mIoU Analysis

**Current Performance Estimate**: ~45-55% mIoU  
**Target Performance**: 80-85% mIoU  
**Performance Gap**: 25-40% improvement needed

**Reasoning for Current Estimate**:
- Model successfully detects road infrastructure (positive)
- Limited to single class detection (significant limitation)
- Geographic accuracy is high (positive)
- Missing specialized lane marking classes (major gap)
