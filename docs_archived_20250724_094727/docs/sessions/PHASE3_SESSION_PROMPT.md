# 🎯 Phase 3 Session Prompt: Specialized Lane Training for 80-85% mIoU Target

## Session Context

Continue development of the **LaneSegNet road infrastructure analysis system**. Phase 2 (enhanced multi-class detection) is **COMPLETE** with significant achievements committed to GitHub (commit `ce88fea`). The system has achieved **65-70% mIoU** with enhanced CV pipeline but requires specialized model training to reach the **80-85% mIoU target** for premium feature differentiation.

## Current System Status ✅

**Enhanced Performance**: Multi-class detection operational with 0.81s response time  
**Model Accuracy**: 65-70% mIoU (↑44% from baseline 45-55%)  
**Class Detection**: 3+ lane types (single_white_dashed, single_yellow_solid, crosswalk)  
**Infrastructure**: Production-ready Docker container with enhanced CV pipeline  
**Training Ready**: Fine-tuning scripts prepared and dataset validated  

## Critical Performance Target 🎯

**Current Model Accuracy**: 65-70% mIoU  
**Target Model Accuracy**: 80-85% mIoU  
**Remaining Gap**: 15-20% improvement needed  

**Root Cause**: Still using general ADE20K weights (150 classes) instead of specialized lane marking training (12 classes)

## Phase 3 Objectives

Your task is to **achieve the final 80-85% mIoU target** through specialized model training and optimization:

### Priority 1: Specialized Model Training (CRITICAL PATH)
1. **Execute fine-tuning** - Run prepared training script on AEL dataset
2. **Validate lane-specific weights** - Test 12-class model performance
3. **Performance benchmarking** - Confirm 80-85% mIoU achievement
4. **Model deployment** - Integrate fine-tuned weights into production system

### Priority 2: Class Expansion Validation
1. **12-class detection testing** - Validate all lane marking types
2. **Class accuracy assessment** - Ensure balanced performance across classes
3. **Real-world validation** - Test diverse geographic locations
4. **Performance consistency** - Maintain <2s response time target

### Priority 3: Production Optimization
1. **Load testing** - Validate concurrent request handling
2. **Cost monitoring** - Assess computational efficiency
3. **Integration testing** - Confirm frontend compatibility
4. **Documentation updates** - Reflect final achievements

## Current Working Environment

**Docker Container**: `lanesegnet:latest` running on port 8010  
**Container Status**: Enhanced CV pipeline operational  
**API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8010/analyze_road_infrastructure`  
**GitHub Status**: Phase 2 committed (commit `ce88fea`)  
**Training Infrastructure**: Ready for immediate execution  

## Key Files to Review

**Training Script**: `fine_tune_lane_model.py` - Ready for execution  
**Performance Testing**: `test_phase2_performance.py` - Current benchmarking

### Performance Validation Framework
- **Baseline**: Current 65-70% mIoU with enhanced CV pipeline
- **Target**: 80-85% mIoU with specialized weights
- **Validation**: Multi-coordinate testing across different road types
- **Metrics**: mIoU, class-wise accuracy, response time consistency

## Session Execution Plan

## Context Commands

```bash
# Verify current system status
docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=lanesegnet"
curl http://localhost:8010/health

# Test current Phase 2 performance
python test_phase2_performance.py

# Check training readiness
python fine_tune_lane_model.py  # (dry-run mode)

# Execute specialized training
python fine_tune_lane_model.py --execute

# Validate final performance
python test_phase2_performance.py  # (post-training)

# Check git status and commit
git log --oneline -3
git status
```

## Success Criteria

By the end of this session, achieve:
- [ ] **Specialized model training** completed successfully
- [ ] **80-85% mIoU target** achieved and validated
- [ ] **12-class lane detection** operational across all types

## Critical Notes

⚠️ **Training Time**: Allow 2-4 hours for complete fine-tuning process  
⚠️ **GPU Memory**: Monitor CUDA memory usage during training  
⚠️ **Backup Strategy**: Current enhanced system remains operational during training  
⚠️ **Validation Required**: Must confirm 80-85% mIoU before declaring success
